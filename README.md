<summary><b>🔍 About Me</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

### **☁️ Passionate IT Professional Transitioning to Cloud Engineering**  
With over 5 years of hands-on experience in IT support and system administration, I'm now channeling my technical expertise toward cloud technologies. Currently pursuing Microsoft AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) and AZ-104 (Azure Administrator) certifications, I'm building proficiency in Azure resource provisioning, virtual machine management, and cloud networking.

What drives me is the relentless pursuit of mastering new technologies - whether it's implementing RBAC in Azure AD, optimizing cloud costs, or troubleshooting complex network infrastructures. My recent projects include deploying a 7-room office network (saving £1,500 by repurposing hardware) and building Azure environments from scratch.

### **I thrive in environments where I can**:

✔ Solve technical challenges with scalable solutions  
✔ Bridge the gap between traditional IT and cloud infrastructure  
✔ Continuously learn through certifications and hands-on labs  
✔ Optimize systems that directly impact business productivity  

When not studying Azure architectures, you'll find me experimenting with new cloud tools or mentoring others in IT fundamentals. My goal is to become a cloud solutions architect who transforms business operations through secure, efficient cloud implementations.
